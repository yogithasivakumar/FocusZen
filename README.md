# 1. Overview

This project appears to be a web-based application focused on productivity and session management, possibly incorporating AI capabilities. It includes a user login system, a timer interface, and features for viewing history and summaries of sessions. The presence of `gemini.js` suggests integration with an AI service for tasks like summarization, likely applied to user activities recorded by the timer. The backend, served by `index.js`, handles user authentication and serves the various frontend pages.

# 3. Project Workflow (Mermaid + Explanation)

This workflow outlines a typical user interaction with the application, from accessing it to interacting with its core features.

    AccessApplication --> UserLogin
    UserLogin --> StartTimerSession
    StartTimerSession --> ViewSessionSummary
```

**Access Application:** A user first navigates to the application's URL, loading the initial `index.html` or `login.html` page.

**User Login:** The user provides credentials through the `login.html` interface. These credentials are sent to the `POST /login` endpoint on the `BackendServer` for authentication.

**Start Timer Session:** After successful login, the user accesses the `timer.html` page to initiate a productivity session. This likely involves client-side JavaScript (`script.js`) managing the timer and potentially triggering an `alarm.mp3`.

**View Session Summary:** Upon completing or ending a timer session, the user can navigate to `summarize.html` or `history.html` to review their past sessions. It's inferred that `gemini.js` might process session data to provide AI-generated summaries, which are then displayed to the user.

# 4. API Endpoints

The project exposes the following API endpoints:

*   **`GET /hello`**:
    *   **Description**: A basic endpoint likely used for health checks or to confirm the server is running. It might return a simple "Hello" message.
    *   **Source**: `index.js`
*   **`POST /login`**:
    *   **Description**: Handles user authentication requests. Users send their login credentials to this endpoint, and the server processes them to verify identity.
    *   **Source**: `index.js`
