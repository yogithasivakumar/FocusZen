# 1. Overview

This project is a web application designed to provide users with productivity tools and an AI-powered content summarizer. It features a multi-page frontend accessible via `index.html`, `login.html`, `timer.html`, `summarize.html`, `history.html`, and `about.html`. Key functionalities include user authentication through a `/login` endpoint, a dedicated timer with an alarm, and content summarization, strongly suggested by the presence of `gemini.js`, indicating integration with the Google Gemini AI model. The backend, handled by `index.js`, serves these pages and provides necessary API interactions, while `script.js` manages client-side behaviors and `style.css` defines the visual presentation.

# 3. Project Workflow (Mermaid + Explanation)

```mermaid

    UserAccessesLogin --> UserAuthenticates
    UserAuthenticates --> ApplicationLoadsDashboard
    ApplicationLoadsDashboard --> UserManagesTimer
    UserManagesTimer --> UserSummarizesContent
```

**Explanation of Workflow:**

1.  **User Accesses Login**: A user navigates to the application's login page (`login.html`) to begin their session.
2.  **User Authenticates**: The user provides credentials, which are sent to the `POST /login` API endpoint for verification.
3.  **Application Loads Dashboard**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main application interface or a dashboard (`index.html` or similar landing page).
4.  **User Manages Timer**: From the dashboard, the user can navigate to the timer page (`timer.html`) to start, stop, or reset a timer, potentially utilizing the `alarm.mp3` for notifications.
5.  **User Summarizes Content**: The user can then proceed to the summarization page (`summarize.html`) to input text or content, which is processed by the integrated AI service (via `gemini.js`) to generate a summary.

    *   **Source**: `index.js`
    *   **Description**: A simple test or greeting endpoint, likely used to confirm the server's operational status.
*   **POST /login**
    *   **Source**: `index.js`
    *   **Description**: Handles user authentication, allowing users to submit their credentials to gain access to the application's features.
