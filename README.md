# 1. Overview

This project appears to be a web application, providing a range of functionalities including user authentication, information pages, and utility tools. It features a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, connected to a Node.js backend server. The presence of `gemini.js` strongly suggests integration with an AI service, possibly for summarization or other intelligent features. Additionally, files like `timer.html` and `alarm.mp3` indicate a timer or reminder utility is part of the application's capabilities.

**Explanation of Workflow:**

1.  **Access Web App:** A user initiates interaction by navigating to the application's main page in their browser.
2.  **User Login:** The user attempts to authenticate by submitting their credentials through the login page (`login.html`), which sends a `POST` request to the backend `/login` endpoint.
3.  **Server Authenticate:** The `index.js` backend server processes the login request, verifies the credentials, and responds with an authentication status.
4.  **View Application Features:** Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to various application features, potentially viewing content from pages like `index.html`, `summarize.html`, or `timer.html`, and can interact with the server, for instance, via the `/hello` endpoint.

# 4. API Endpoints

*   **GET /hello**
    *   **Description:** This endpoint serves as a basic greeting or status check. It likely returns a simple message to confirm the server is running and accessible, or to provide a default welcome.
*   **POST /login**
    *   **Description:** Handles user authentication. It expects user credentials (e.g., username and password) to be sent in the request body, processes them, and attempts to log the user into the application. Upon successful login, it might establish a user session.
