# 1. Overview

This project appears to be a web-based application focused on providing several interactive tools to a user, including a timer/alarm functionality and potentially content summarization. It features a frontend built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that interacts with a backend server developed in Node.js, providing functionalities such as user login and basic API responses. The presence of `gemini.js` suggests an integration with the Google Gemini AI service, likely for enhanced features like text processing or summarization, as indicated by `summarize.html`. User authentication is a core component, managed through a dedicated login page and a backend API endpoint.

# 3. Project Workflow (Mermaid + Explanation)

This workflow describes how a user typically interacts with the application, focusing on the initial login process and subsequent access to features.

    UserAccessesLogin --> UserAuthenticates
    UserAuthenticates --> SystemVerifiesCredentials
    SystemVerifiesCredentials --> UserAccessesApplication
```

**Workflow Explanation:**

1.  **User Accesses Login:** A user navigates to the `login.html` page to begin interacting with the application.
2.  **User Authenticates:** The user enters their credentials (username/password) into the login form. This information is then sent to the backend.
3.  **System Verifies Credentials:** The backend server, via the `POST /login` API endpoint in `index.js`, receives and processes the submitted credentials to determine if they are valid.
4.  **User Accesses Application:** If authentication is successful, the user is granted access to the main application interface, likely `index.html`, from where they can navigate to features like the timer or summarization.

# 4. API Endpoints

The project exposes the following API endpoints through its `index.js` backend server:

*   **GET /hello**
    *   **Description:** A simple endpoint designed to return a greeting. This is typically used for testing server responsiveness or as a basic welcome message.
*   **POST /login**
    *   **Description:** Handles user authentication. It expects user credentials (e.g., username and password) in the request body, processes them, and responds with an indication of successful or failed login.

# 5. Recent Commit History (Last 5)

The recent commit history primarily highlights a strong focus on documentation automation. Four out of the last five commits are dedicated to automatically generating the `README.md` using AutoDocs, indicating an ongoing effort to maintain up-to-date and dynamic project documentation. The single non-documentation commit suggests a minor cleanup or removal of a test-related file, pointing to some level of active development or refactoring alongside the documentation work.
