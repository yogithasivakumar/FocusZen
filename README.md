# 1. Overview

This project appears to be a client-side web application with a minimal backend server. It provides a user interface for various features including a timer, a summary tool, and a history log, along with an "about" section. User authentication is managed through a login page and a backend API. The presence of `gemini.js` suggests a specialized JavaScript functionality, possibly related to AI or a specific library. An `alarm.mp3` file indicates the timer feature likely includes audio alerts.

    AccessApp --> EnterCredentials
    EnterCredentials --> AuthenticateUser
    AuthenticateUser --> ViewDashboard
    ViewDashboard --> UseFeatures
```

**Explanation of Workflow:**
1.  **AccessApp**: A user navigates to the application's URL, loading `index.html` or `login.html`.
2.  **EnterCredentials**: If required, the user enters their username and password on the `login.html` page.
3.  **AuthenticateUser**: The client-side scripts send the credentials to the backend via the `POST /login` API endpoint for verification.
4.  **ViewDashboard**: Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the main application dashboard, likely `index.html`, where they can see an overview or navigation options.
5.  **UseFeatures**: From the dashboard, the user can navigate to and interact with specific features like the timer (`timer.html`), history (`history.html`), summary tool (`summarize.html`), or about page (`about.html`).

# 4. API Endpoints

*   **GET /hello** (from `index.js`)
    *   This endpoint likely serves as a basic health check or a simple welcome message from the server.
*   **POST /login** (from `index.js`)
    *   This endpoint is responsible for handling user authentication requests, processing submitted credentials to verify a user's identity.
